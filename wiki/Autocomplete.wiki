== HIVE Core ==
=== vocabulary.properties ===

A new {{{autocomplete}}} property has been added to the {{{vocabulary.properties}}} file. This property specifies the path to the directory that will contain the autocomplete index.

=== AdminVocabularies ===

A new flag {{{-x}}} has been added to the {{{AdminVocabularies}}} class to support initialization of the {{{autocomplete}}} index:

{{{java edu.unc.ils.mrc.hive.admin.AdminVocabularies -c <path-to-conf-dir> -v <vocabulary> -x }}}

Specifying this flag will create the autocomplete index.

=== Autocomplete class ===

A new class {{{edu.unc.ils.mrc.hive.ir.lucene.search.Autocomplete}}} has been added to the {{{hive-core.jar}}}. This class handles the initialization of the autocomplete Lucene index and term suggestion (search).

== HIVE Web ==

=== Autocomplete Servlet ===

A new servlet {{{org.unc.hive.servlet.AutocompleteServlet}}} has been added to the {{{hiveweb}}} web application. This servlet accepts two parameters {{{cv}}} and {{{term}}} and returns a JSON-based response with suggested terms.

=== Autocomplete Widget ===

A simple JQuery-based autocomplete widget has been added to the project to demonstrate one possible integration approach.
