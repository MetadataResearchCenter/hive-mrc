#summary How to import a new vocabulary into HIVE
 
HIVE is able to import any vocabulary from a RDF/SKOS file. If the
vocabulary is in another format, it must be converted into SKOS before importing.

In order to import a new vocabulary you must:
  # Create a configuration file with the paths to the files and indexes that will be generated by the HIVE import tools. 
  # Run the AdminVocabularies class to perform the import

== How to create your configuration file ==
                                                                                
Each vocabulary has its own configuration file, with the following format:

Place the configuration file in the same directory as the file "vocabularies". The vocabularies is used by SKOSServer identify which vocabularies will be opened.

The HIVE configuration directory may look like:

{{{
conf/
  vocabularies
  nbii.properties
  lcsh.properties
  mesh.properties
  agrovoc.properties                                                                   
}}}
       
== AdminVocabularies ==

Before running AdminVocabularies, make sure Tomcat is not running.

AdminVocabularies takes these parameters:
    # Path to configuration directory
    # Name of the vocabulary
    # Activate training option for KEA algorithm (optional, If you don't train your system, you can not use automatic indexing classes)                                                      
    

For example (with training): 
{{{
java  -Djava.ext.dirs=/home/hive-rs/WebRoot/WEB-INF/lib  edu.unc.ils.mrc.hive.admin.AdminVocabularies /home/hive-rs/WebRoot/WEB-INF/conf/ lter train
}}}

To load the vocabulary without training, omit the parameter "train".

Once the vocabulary has been loaded, you may start Tomcat and test to make sure the vocabulary is working properly.
