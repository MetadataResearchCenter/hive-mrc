#summary Describes the MeSH to SKOS conversion process


== About MeSH ==

The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary maintained by the National Library of Medicine intended for the indexing and cataloging of biomedical information resources. MeSH is used for indexing of journals in the MEDLINE/PUBMED databases as well as books, articles, and other materials acquired by the library^1^. The MeSH thesaurus contains over 26,000 descriptors representing 177,000 terms.

== MeSH Structure ==

The following files can be downloaded from the NLM website (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/filelist.html). Only the descriptor records are used for this conversion.
 * desc2011.xml
 * qual2011.xml
 * supp2011.xml

=== Descriptors, Concepts, and Terms ===

Descriptors are used to index documents. Most descriptors are used to identify the subject of an indexed document (topical). Some descriptors in the thesaurus are not intended for topical indexing (publication types, geographic descriptors).

 * Each Descriptor contains one or more related Concepts
   * Descriptors are topical or non-topical
   * Descriptors are assigned on or more Tree Numbers
   * One Concept within the Descriptor is the preferred Concept
   * All Concepts within a Descriptor share common Tree Numbers
   * Each Concept contains one or more synonymous Terms
     * One Term within each Concept is the preferred Term
   * Concepts within each Descriptor are related (BRD, NRW, REL)
   * Descriptors are related
     * Through the MeSH hierarchy
     * Through specific elements ({{{DescriptorReferredTo}}}) including {{{SeeRelatedDescriptor}}}, {{{PharmacologicalAction}}}, {{{ECIN}}}, {{{ECOUT}}}.

=== Qualifiers ===

The MeSH vocabulary contains 83 topical qualifiers for use with descriptors. Not all qualifiers can be used with every descriptor. Each descriptor record contains a list of allowable modifiers.


=== Supplementary Concept Records ===

Supplementary Concept Records (SCR) are used to index specific chemicals and drugs. SCRs do not have tree numbers, but are related to Descriptors through the {{{HeadingMappedTo}}} element.


== Relationships ==

Broader and narrower concepts are determined by: 
 * Tree number: Parent concepts are broader, child concepts are narrower
 * Concept relations (BRD, NRW)

Related concepts are determined by:
 * Descriptor relations: e.g., {{{SeeRelatedList}}}
 * Concept relations (REL)

== Mesh-to-SKOS ==

The current HIVE MeSH-to-SKOS converter is implemented in the {{{edu.unc.ils.mrc.MeshConverter}} class. This is a SAX-based XML parser that reads the {{{desc2011.xml}}} file and SKOS concepts from the MeSH each {{{DescriptorRecord}}}. 

The MeSH {{{Concept}}} is mapped to a SKOS Concept. The MeSH {{{DescriptorRecord}}} is used to determine the position in the hierarchy ({{{TreeNumber}}}) and relationships between descriptors ({{{SeeRelatedDescriptors}}}). Concepts within related Descriptors are related.

Notes:
 * Qualifiers are not supported
 * Supplementary Concept Records are not supported

Mapping:
 * For each descriptor
  * Is it a topical descriptor ({{{DescriptorClass}}} = 1)
  * Get tree numbers ({{{TreeNumberList}}})
    * Parent node maps to {{{skos:broader}}}
    * Child node maps to {{{skos:narrower}}}
  * Get descriptor relations ({{{SeeRelatedList}}})
  * Get concepts ({{{ConceptList}}})
  * For each concept (maps to {{{skos:concept}}})
    * Is it the preferred concept?
    * Get the scope note ({{{ScopeNote}}})
      * Maps to {{{skos:scopeNote}}}
    * Get concept relations ({{{ConceptRelationList}}})
      * {{{NRW}}} maps to {{{skos:narrower}}}
      * {{{BRD}}} maps to {{{skos:broader}}}
      * {{{REL}}} maps to {{{skos:related}}}
    * Get the term list ({{{TermList}}})
    * For each term
      * Is it the preferred term?
        * {{{Y}}} maps to {{{skos:prefLabel}}}
        * {{{N}}} maps to {{{skos:altLabel}}}

 


== MeSH to SKOS ==



For each Concept:
 * Get related concepts based on descriptor relations
 * Get broader concepts based on concept relations
 * Get narrower concepts based on concept relations
 * Get related concepts based on concept relations
 * Get terms for the concept
