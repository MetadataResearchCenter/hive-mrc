#summary Describes the MeSH to SKOS conversion process

== Overview ==

The National Library of Medicine (NLM) does not offer an official SKOS-formatted version of the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). This document describes one approach to converting the MeSH vocabulary from the NLM provided XML format to SKOS for indexing in HIVE.

== Earlier Efforts ==

Van Assem _et al_ propose a method of converting thesauri to SKOS, including MeSH. The original paper and Prolog application are available for download from http://thesauri.cs.vu.nl/eswc06/. 

The method described by Van Assem _et al_ maps each MeSH descriptor to a SKOS concept. The name of the preferred term of the preferred concept is mapped to SKOS prefLabel and each non-preferred MeSH term to SKOS altLabel. The authors recognize that, through mapping descriptors to SKOS concepts, information about MeSH concepts and terms is lost. The relations between concepts within a descriptor as well as the preferred term for a non-preferred concept are not capture. The programmatic implementation does not generate the narrower relationship as required by HIVE for indexing.

The proposal outlined in this document builds off of their earlier work, but takes an alternative approach.  Each MeSH concept is mapped to a SKOS concept and the MeSH descriptor is used for additional relationship information. Preferred and non-preferred MeSH terms are mapped to prefLabel and altLabel for each concept. Relationships between concepts within descriptors are maintained. Additional relationships between concepts are inferred from relationships between descriptors. 

A recognized limitation of the Core SKOS model, the distinction between preferred and non-preferred MeSH concepts are not captured. Qualifiers and Supplementary Concept Records are not supported in this mapping.


== About MeSH ==

The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary maintained by the National Library of Medicine intended for the indexing and cataloging of biomedical information resources. MeSH is used for indexing of journals in the MEDLINE/PUBMED databases as well as books, articles, and other materials acquired by the library^1^. The MeSH thesaurus contains over 26,000 descriptors representing 177,000 terms.

== MeSH Structure ==


The following files can be downloaded from the NLM website (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/filelist.html). Only the descriptor records are used for this conversion.
 * desc2011.xml
 * qual2011.xml
 * supp2011.xml

=== Descriptors, Concepts, and Terms ===

Descriptors are used to index documents. Most descriptors are used to identify the subject of an indexed document (topical). Some descriptors in the thesaurus are not intended for topical indexing (publication types, geographic descriptors).

 * Each Descriptor contains one or more related Concepts
   * Descriptors are topical or non-topical
   * Descriptors are assigned on or more Tree Numbers
   * One Concept within the Descriptor is the preferred Concept
   * All Concepts within a Descriptor share common Tree Numbers
   * Each Concept contains one or more synonymous Terms
     * One Term within each Concept is the preferred Term
   * Concepts within each Descriptor are related (BRD, NRW, REL)
   * Descriptors are related
     * Through the MeSH hierarchy
     * Through specific elements ({{{DescriptorReferredTo}}}) including {{{SeeRelatedDescriptor}}}, {{{PharmacologicalAction}}}, {{{ECIN}}}, {{{ECOUT}}}.

=== Qualifiers ===

The MeSH vocabulary contains 83 topical qualifiers for use with descriptors. Not all qualifiers can be used with every descriptor. Each descriptor record contains a list of allowable modifiers.


=== Supplementary Concept Records ===

Supplementary Concept Records (SCR) are used to index specific chemicals and drugs. SCRs do not have tree numbers, but are related to Descriptors through the {{{HeadingMappedTo}}} element.


== Relationships ==

Broader and narrower concepts are determined by: 
 * Tree number: Parent concepts are broader, child concepts are narrower
 * Concept relations (BRD, NRW)

Related concepts are determined by:
 * Descriptor relations: e.g., {{{SeeRelatedList}}}
 * Concept relations (REL)

== Converting MeSH to SKOS ==

The MeSH {{{Concept}}} is mapped to a SKOS Concept. The MeSH {{{DescriptorRecord}}} is used to determine the position in the hierarchy ({{{TreeNumber}}}) and relationships between descriptors ({{{SeeRelatedDescriptors}}}). Concepts within related Descriptors are related.

Notes:
 * Qualifiers are not supported
 * Supplementary Concept Records are not supported

Mapping:
 * For each descriptor
  * Is it a topical descriptor ({{{DescriptorClass}}} = 1)
  * Get tree numbers ({{{TreeNumberList}}})
    * Parent node maps to {{{skos:broader}}}
    * Child node maps to {{{skos:narrower}}}
  * Get descriptor relations ({{{SeeRelatedList}}})
  * Get concepts ({{{ConceptList}}})
  * For each concept (maps to {{{skos:concept}}})
    * Is it the preferred concept?
    * Get the scope note ({{{ScopeNote}}})
      * Maps to {{{skos:scopeNote}}}
    * Get concept relations ({{{ConceptRelationList}}})
      * {{{NRW}}} maps to {{{skos:narrower}}}
      * {{{BRD}}} maps to {{{skos:broader}}}
      * {{{REL}}} maps to {{{skos:related}}}
    * Get the term list ({{{TermList}}})
    * For each term
      * Is it the preferred term?
        * {{{Y}}} maps to {{{skos:prefLabel}}}
        * {{{N}}} maps to {{{skos:altLabel}}}


== Example ==

The MeSH entry for descriptor "Cardiomegaly" contains two concepts.

== Implementation ==

The current HIVE MeSH-to-SKOS converter is implemented in the {{{edu.unc.ils.mrc.MeshConverter}}} class. This is a SAX-based XML parser that reads from {{{desc2011.xml}}}.
