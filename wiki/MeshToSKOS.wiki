Broader and Narrower Concepts:
 * Determined by Tree Number
   * Which Concepts are a parent of this Concept (broader)
   * Which Concepts are children of this Concept (narrower)
 * Determined by Concept Relation
   * What is the relationship between Concepts in a Descriptor (BRD, NRW)
 
Related Concepts:
 * See Related List
   * Related Concepts are based on related Descriptors
 * Concept Relation
   * What is the relationship between Concepts in a Descriptor (REL)

 * Each Descriptor includes one or more Concepts
 * A Concept may be preferred or non-preferred
 * Each Concept includes one or more Terms
 * A Term may be preferred or non-preferred
 * Each Descriptor includes one or more Tree Numbers
 * All Concepts within a Descriptor share common Tree Numbers
 * All Concepts within a Descriptor are related by ConceptRelations
 * ConceptRelations are NRW, BRD, or REL
 * A Descriptor may include related descriptors (DescriptorReferredTo)
   * PharmacologicalAction 
   * SeeRelatedDescriptor
   * ECIN and ECOUT are ignored (Qualifiers are not supported)


The current MeSH-to-SKOS converter 
 * edu.unc.ils.mrc.MeshTreeParser
 * SAX-based XML parser
 * Reads desc2011.xml
 * Constructs a set of Concepts from Descriptors
   * Descriptors are only used to identify relations between Concepts
 * For each Concept:
   * Get broader concepts based on tree number
   * Get narrower concepts based on tree number
   * Get terms 
   * Get related concepts based on descriptors
   * Get broader concepts based on Concept relation
   * Get narrower concepts based on Concept relation
   * Get related concepts based on Concept relation
