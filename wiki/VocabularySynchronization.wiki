#summary How to synchronize HIVE with external vocabulary services


= Vocabulary Synchronization =

One of the challenges of a centralized vocabulary service is keeping the vocabularies up-to-date with the external sources. For example, the Library of Congress publishes vocabulary changes as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29 Atom] feed via http://id.loc.gov/authorities/feed/. Changes are loaded every 3-4 weeks.

With the 2.0 release, the HIVE service includes support for synchronization of the LCSH vocabulary with the LC Atom feed. This page describes the implementation.

== lcsh.properties ==

Two new optional properties have been added to the {{{lcsh.properties}}} file:
  * {{{creationDate}}}:  Creation date of the SKOS/RDF file. This is used to determine the last update date during the initial synchronization.
  * {{{atomFeedURL}}}: URL of the atom feed used for synchronization.

== H2 Database Chances ==

The HIVE 2.0 API introduces a new SETTINGS table in the H2 database for each vocabulary. The SETTINGS table includes a new column LAST_UPDATE that is updated during each import or add/update/remove of a concept. The last update date is used during sychronization.


== HIVE-Core ==

A new class {{{edu.unc.ils.mrc.hive.sync.lcsh.AtomSynchronizer}}} has been added to the {{{hive-core.jar}}}. This class implements the actual synchronization process -- reading updated concepts from the atom feed and acting on the HIVE data store. Adds, updates, and removes are applied across each of the HIVE indexes (Sesame, Lucene, H2).


== HIVE-Web ==

Automatic synchronization has been implemented using the [http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/ Quartz] scheduler in the {{{hiveweb}}} web application.

Configuration:
  * {{{quartz-jobs.xml}}}: Specifies the synchronization job class and the cron-based trigger configuration (how frequently the updates run)
  * {{{quartz.properties}}}: General Quartz configuration
  
Synchronization job:
  * {{{edu.unc.hive.sync.SyncJob}}} implements the Quarts {{{Job}}} interface. Currently this job only updates the LCSH vocabulary using the above {{{AtomSynchronizer}}} class.
