= What is HIVE? =

HIVE is an automatic metadata generation approach that dynamically integrates discipline-specific controlled vocabularies encoded with the Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS), a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard. HIVE will assist content creators and information professionals with subject cataloging and will provide a solution to the traditional controlled vocabulary problems of cost, interoperability, and usability.
