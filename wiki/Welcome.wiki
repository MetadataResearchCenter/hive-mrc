= What is HIVE? =

HIVE is an automatic metadata generation approach that dynamically integrates discipline-specific controlled vocabularies encoded with the Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS), a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard. HIVE will assist content creators and information professionals with subject cataloging and will provide a solution to the traditional controlled vocabulary problems of cost, interoperability, and usability.

HIVE functions:
 * Conversion of vocabularies to SKOS
 * Rich internet application (RIA) for browsing and searching multiple SKOS vocabularies
 * Java API and REST application interfaces for programmatic access to multiple SKOS vocabularies
 * Automatic keyphrase indexing using multiple SKOS vocabularies. HIVE supports two indexers:
   * KEA++ indexer
   * Basic Lucene indexer
