# What is HIVE? #

HIVE is a framework and service for the integration of multiple controlled vocabularies and thesauri using Simple Knowledge Organization (SKOS) format.

HIVE features can be used in three ways:
  * [HIVE Web](AboutHiveWeb.md): GWT-based web application
  * [Core API](AboutHiveCore.md): Java SE API for programmatic access
  * [REST Service](AboutHiveRestService.md): REST-based service for programmatic access

HIVE supports the following functions:
  * Conversion of various vocabularies to SKOS
  * Browsing and searching SKOS vocabularies (Concept Browser)
  * Automatic controlled indexing using [KEA++](http://www.nzdl.org/Kea/), [Maui](https://code.google.com/p/maui-indexer/), and simple Lucene-based indexers.
