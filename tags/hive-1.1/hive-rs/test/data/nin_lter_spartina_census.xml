<geographicCoverage id="geoReference">
<geographicDescription>North Inlet encompasses about 2,630 hectares of tidal marshes and wetlands near Georgetown, South Carolina, USA. North Inlet-Winyah Bay features high quality, ocean-dominated waters and salt marshes in North Inlet, contrasting with the brackish waters and marshes of Winyah Bay. The bay estuary is dominated by riverine discharges from a watershed impacted by agricultural, municipal and industrial development. Former rice fields  and canals provide another system for study within the Reserve. The Debidue site is located at the confluence of Town Creek and Debidue Creek. The Bread and Butter site is located along the western shoreline of Town Creek adjacent to the mouth of Clambank Creek.  GI is in the marsh east of Goat Island. It is accessible from Clambank Rd. about 1/4 mile from the firetower.  A board walk connects the high marsh site and the low marsh site.  OL is in the Oyster Landing basin. 
 The high marsh site is located on the north side of the road which leads to the landing. The low marsh site lies between the boardwalk to the MET station and the small channel to the boat landing. GI is the older marsh site: the marsh sediments are about 50 cm deep, Organic content is somewhat higher, and it is closer to the ocean than OL. OL is a young marsh near the forest and close to a stream which drains a  small forested watershed after big rainfalls.  Salinities are often, but not always lower at OL.  Spartina stem densities are lower at OL than at GI but annual production at the two sites is similar.

<section><title>Entry verification</title>
<para><literalLayout>     Multiple levels of entry verification were performed.  Data were initially     checked for entry errors by Betsy Haskin.  Once all data entry errors were     corrected, hard copies of the data on the system were proofed against the     original raw data sheets. Flags in the programs caught missing months,     duplicate plant numbers, and large increases in plant height.</literalLayout></para></section>

   <para><literalLayout>each study site three plots (1.2 m x 1.2 m) were laid out.
     Inside each plot there were two subplots in which all stems were tagged.
     The stems were censused monthly and biomass and production were
     calculated. At Goat Island there were 3 nitrogen fertilized plots in
     addition to the 3 control plots.</literalLayout></para>

	 Plant heights (the raw data) were converted to biomass by a series
     of algorithms. The equations were derived from seasonal harvests of
     hundreds of Spartina stems.  Production was calculated for each plot by
     summing all the individual increases in stem biomass within the plot.</literalLayout></para>

<definition> Indentifier for the plant: is 12 digit with a decimal between the first 6 and the second six. The first 6 digits specify the parent of a stem if it is known. The second 6 digits specify the stem. 
Example:      117901.112302
Stems large enough to hold a band are tagged. Band color is indicated by the first digit: 1=red,2=blue,3=yellow,4=white,5=pink. Digits 2,3,4 are the band number (1-200). Digits 5 and 6 are the number of times the particular tag has been used. A sprout that is too small for a tag is identified (as in above example) by its parent  and then is numbered 1,2,3 etc. for as many small sprouts as the parent has.
